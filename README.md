# Learning a new Framework 

I recently started learning Spring Boot. This is my first ever web app created in Spring boot. 
It is a simple backend app in which CRUD functions are created using Rest APIs. 
All the apis work properly and have been tested on Postman.
Mysql database is used for this.
Might integrate the project with React in the frontend later probably :/ .
